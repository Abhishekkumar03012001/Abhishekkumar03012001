## Projects
- **Airport Management System (DBMS & SQL):** I have developed an Airport Management System using DBMS and SQL. This project aims to efficiently manage various aspects of airport operations such as flight schedules, passenger information, ticketing, and baggage handling. It incorporates a robust database design and implements SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data. You can find the project repository .

- **Python Voice Assistant:** I have also been working on a Python-based voice assistant. The goal of this project is to create an interactive voice assistant that can perform tasks based on voice commands. It utilizes speech recognition, natural language processing, and various Python libraries to provide a seamless user experience. I am open to collaboration on this project to further enhance its capabilities. If you're interested in contributing, please reach out to me.
